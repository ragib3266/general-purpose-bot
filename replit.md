## Overview
This is a Discord bot built with discord.py that provides various utility commands including:

- Pokémon information lookup via PokéAPI
- Random communist/anticommunist leader names
- Custom user mentions and responses

## Recent Changes

  - Installed Python 3.11 and all required dependencies
  - Configured Discord Bot workflow to run main.py
  - Bot token stored securely in Replit Secrets as TOKEN
  - Bot successfully connected to Discord gateway

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Main Framework**: discord.py (v2.6.4)
- **Entry Point**: `main.py`
- **Bot Prefix**: `!` (e.g., `!helpme`)

### Key Dependencies

## Running the Bot
The bot runs automatically via the configured workflow. It will:
1. Connect to Discord using the TOKEN secret
2. Listen for commands with the `!` prefix
3. Respond to various utility commands

## Files
- `main.py` - Main bot code with all commands and event handlers
- `Procfile` - Original Heroku deployment config (not used in Replit)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies list (has encoding issues but dependencies installed)
